# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice Repository

Welcome to our Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository. This repository is a private space for our team to improve our coding skills and knowledge of DSA. Here, we will regularly release DSA tasks and challenges for everyone to work on in their respective programming languages.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Certifieddonnie/Data-Structure-Algorithms.git
   ```
2. **Check the Week's Task:** Check the Projects Board for this week DSA Challenge
     [Weekly Challenges](https://github.com/Certifieddonnie/Data-Structure-Algorithms/projects)
3. **Work on the Tasks:**
   
   a.) Create a branch <your-language/the-week's-challenge-name>
   
       Example: python/puzzle-palooza
   b.) Make sure all your task files are done in your own language folder to avoid merge clashes
   c.) Make commits after each Task is done. Commit Syntax below:

       Syntax: git commit "[feat]: <your-lang> <the-week's-challenge-name> Task <task-number>"
       Example: git commit "[feat]: python puzzle-palooza Task 1"
4. **Tasks Submission:** Create a pull request with your solution. Your code will be reviewed and merged into the main branch
5. **Discussions and Issues:** Engage in discussions, Create issues on technicalities or misunderstandings.
